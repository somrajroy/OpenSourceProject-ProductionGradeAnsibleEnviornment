* [Follow the steps to install a host for each distro (debian, centos & ubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIKFxK2Gfnc). <br/>
* Follow the steps carefully to ensure internet access for all the VDI's. Ubuntu and Debian would work fine but CentOS can give issues and [this video will resolve the problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxookDRgOZM).<br/>
