#### Set up of a real time production scenario of various Linux hosts (distros) which can be managed centrally with Ansible Master. <br/><br/>

* Instal virtual box and download latest versions (64bit) of Debian, Ubuntu & Cent OS VDI's from [OS Box images for virtual box](https://www.osboxes.org/virtualbox-images/).<br/>
* [Follow the steps to install a host for each distro (debian, centos & ubuntu)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIKFxK2Gfnc). <br/>
* Follow the steps carefully to ensure internet access for all the VDI's. Ubuntu and Debian would work fine but CentOS can give issues and [this video will resolve the problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxookDRgOZM).<br/>
* For CentOS download the "Workstation" (not the server). <br/>
* Password would be in the info tab. <br/>

* Start the servers and SSH into them through MobaXterm. <br/>
* [Make any one of the server as Ansible master and install Ansible.](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html). Verify by running the command "ansible --version".<br/>
* In Ansible master create any folder (e.g. ansible_test) and change directory to it (mkdir ansible_test & cd ansible_test). <br/>
* Create file ansible.cfg and enter the below two commands. <br/>
  $ nano ansible.cfg <br/>

* Group your remote hosts as per OS and enter the login credentials in the ":vars" section as below. Change the IP addresses with your's. For sudo user password add "ansible_become_password".<br/>

* To check connectivity run the playbook ping_test.yaml with below command & the output will be similar to image below. Source code uploaded in this repository.<br/>
  $ ansible-playbook ping_test.yaml <br/>

* Connectivity can also be checked by running the below adhoc command and output would be like image below. <br/>

* To check OS releases of each remote hosts run the below ansible playbook and output will be similar to the image below (playbook source code uploaded). <br/>
  $ ansible-playbook os-release1.yaml
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92582005/208141323-ea01b920-f23f-4cf1-9d93-ad0dab9fb98c.png) <br/>
* OS release can also be checked by running the below adhoc command and the output will be as the image. <br/>
  $ ansible all -a "cat /etc/os-release" <br/>

* The real time lab is now set up. The machines can be shut down from virtual box and restarted anytime later. More complex ansible automation tasks can be performed in setup as it mimics a production environment with different linux distros. <br/>
